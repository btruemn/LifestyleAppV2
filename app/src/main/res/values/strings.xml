    <string name="bmi_description">
        BMI or Body Mass Index is an indirect measure of your body composition â€” or how much
        body fat you have. Although BMI doesn\'t measure body fat directly, it uses your weight and
        height to determine whether you\'re classified as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or
        obese. BMI is measured by dividing your weight in pounds by the square of your height in
        inches, then multiplying by 703. BMI = (weight / height * height) * 703.

    <string name="bmr_description">
        BMR or Basal Metabolic Rate is the number of calories your body burns at rest to do basic
        functions like breathing, digesting, keeping your heart beating, and all of the other
        physiological tasks that keep you alive. Your BMR is partly determined by genetics, but
        other factors, like your body composition and activity level, may also have an effect on
        your BMR. There are equations used to determine your BMR, and they differ based on whether
        you\'re a man or a woman. BMR can be calculated with the Harris-Benedict equation.
